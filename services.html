          <h4>Holistic Massage</h4>
          <p>
            The word "Holistic" is a Greek word meaning "whole". This form of massage deals with you as a "whole”. Like other therapies,
            this treatment will not just mask symptoms but rather establish the cause both internal or external. The aim
            is to rebalance the body so it achieves homeostasis or balance.
            <br /> The benefits of a holistic massage are both mind and body and it has a definite restorative effect. The massage
            can encourage tight muscles to relax and this, combined with strokes to aid lymphatic drainage, helps to release
            toxins.
            <br /> The benefits can be enjoyed by all ages, backgrounds and lifestyles.
          </p>

          <h4>Swedish Massage</h4>
          <p>
            Swedish Massage refers to a variety of techniques specifically designed to relax muscles by applying pressure to them against
            deeper muscles and bones, massaging in the same direction as blood flow returning to the heart.
            <br /> The main purpose of this therapy is to increase the oxygen flow in the blood and release toxins from the muscles.
            <br /> The benefits of this style of massage are vast. Possible benefits include; Improved recovery time from muscular
            strain by flushing the tissues of lactic acid, uric acid and other metabolic wastes.
            <br /> This tecnique will improve circulation without increasing heart load, stretching of ligaments and tendons and
            stimulation of the skin and nervous system soothing the nervous system at the same time.
            <br /> This treatment will reduce stress while promoting a feeling of health and wellbeing.
            <br />
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id="test2" class="col s12 trans-1">
          <h4>Deep Tissue Massage</h4>
          <p>
            Deep Tissue Massage is a technique that works on the deeper layers of muscle tissue, similar to Swedish massage. The difference
            is that we utilise slower and firmer strokes and pressure than other treatments.
            <br /> This technique utilises deep finger pressure that concentrates on particular areas, and follows or goes across
            the fibres of the muscles and tendons.
            <br /> This is particularly effective for people with muscular pain assisting in refreshing and relaxing muscles, increasing
            the blood flow and therefore the oxygen flow around your body.
            <br /> This gets rid of toxins in very sore and strained muscles, which helps them to strengthen and heal.
            <br /> This treatment is particularly effective to break down scar tissue and "knots" deep in the muscles.
            <br /> The purpose of a deep tissue massage isn't to leave you feeling relaxed and full of bliss like our Holistic
            Massage, but it tends to address specific muscular problems.

          </p>

          <h4>Trigger Point Massage</h4>

          <p>
            Trigger Point Massage is a technique in which direct pressure is applied to specified points on tender muscle tissue to bring
            about reduction in muscle tension and pain relief.
            <br /> Each muscle has potential trigger points which can become activated by muscle overuse, inflammation, trauma,
            electrolyte imbalances, infections and nerve pain. These trigger points can cause pain over the muscle affected
            or refer pain and thus be felt in another area of the body.
            <br /> Other trigger points are only felt when the muscle is directly palpated by the therapist. Trigger Point Massage
            is for almost everyone. Muscles with active trigger points are always weaker than normal muscles and unable to
            move through their full range of motion.
            <br /> Often because they are unable to perform their normal function, other muscles are recruited to perform the activity
            of the compromised muscle.
            <br /> These secondary muscles can go on to develop trigger points themselves if the original muscle is not treated.
          </p>

          <h4>Manual Lymphatic Drainage (MLD)</h4>
          <p>
            Manual Lymphatic Drainage (MLD) is a type of gentle massage, which is intended to encourage the natural drainage of the Lymphatic
            System, which carries waste products away from the tissues back towards the heart.
            <br /> The Lymphatic System depends on intrinsic contractions of the body tissues and the movement of the skeletal
            muscles to propel lymph through the vessels to the Lymph Nodes and then beyond to the Lymph Ducts.
            <br /> MLD uses a specific amount of light pressure and rhythmic circular movements to stimulate lymph flow.
            <br /> MLD is an effective treatment for localised post-traumatic oedema after bruising, distortion, fracture, dislocation
            or surgical procedures.
          </p>

          <h4>Myofacial Release Technique</h4>
          <p>
            Myofacial Release is a gentle sustained pressure that elongates the fascial adhesions so the body can return to proper alignment.
            That's why an analyse is needed to ascertain what is going on in your body and implement ways to fix it.
            <br /> Myofacial Release is a whole body approach which is important because it corrects the dysfunctions rather than
            focussing on the pain.
            <br /> When a person has been in pain for a long time it causes both physical and emotional stress on the body. Pain
            patterns evolve and often the person feels like "the pain is everywhere." Myofascial Release not only works on
            the painful areas, but addresses all areas of dysfunction throughout the body.
            <br /> It allows the body to heal by allowing the blood, lymph, and nerve receptors to work more effectively. By releasing
            endorphins, the body's natural pain killers, it also strengthens the immune system, improves nerve function,
            increases blood circulation
          </p>

          <h4>Positional Release Technique (PRT)</h4>
          <p>
            PRT is a form manual medicine that resolves pain and tissue dysfunction. Through positioning the body and tissue in positions
            of comfort, the neurological system can be manipulated to interrupt the pain spasm cycle and over time to reset
            the resting length of the tissue in a "normal" range, which promotes increase in strength, performance and function.
            <br /> Essentially, PRT is the opposite of stretching, tissues are pushed together, twisted, compressed and manipulated
            to take tension off.
            <br /> The primary goal of PRT is to promote a positive healing environment by correcting musculoskeletal and neurological
            imbalances to facilitate tissue regeneration, growth and repair in order for the body to self-correct itself.
            The technique is pain free and is suited for all ages and most painful conditions.

        <div id="test3" class="col s12 trans-1">
          <h4>Sports Injury Massage</h4>
          <p>
            Sports massage was originally developed to help athletes prepare their bodies for optimal performance, recover after a big
            event, or function well during training also emphasizes prevention and healing of injuries to the muscles and
            tendons.
            <br /> You don't have to be in the Olympics to benefit from sports massage. Sports massage is also good for people
            with injuries, chronic pain or restricted range of motion. I will generally concentrate on a specific problem
            area rather than giving you a thorough full-body massage.
            <br /> The benefits of a sports injury massage is mainly the Increased of blood flow, the increased of joint range
            of motion, increased in flexibility, decreased muscle tension, decreased neurological excitability (nerves more
            relaxed) and decreased chance of injury.
          </p>

          <h4>Pre-Event Sports Massage</h4>
          <p>
            The purpose of the this massage is to prepare an athlete for high intensity activity. The athlete is the final stage of preparation
            and the only job is to get the muscles loose without decreasing their psychological focus or causing significant
            physiological changes in their bodies. It is important to keep in mind that this massage is not looking to correct
            dysfunctions or reduce stress.
            <br /> The main benefits of this massage is to stimulate mind and body, increase circulation and helps the body to
            work at a more optimum level.
          </p>

          <h4>Post Event Sports Massage</h4>
          <p>
            The purpose of the this massage is to help an athlete to recover from high-intensity exercise after a competition or hard
            training session. The main goal of this treatment is to improve circulation, reduce muscle tension and calm down
            body and mind.
            <br /> A Post Event Massage is typically given anywhere from 30 minutes up to 24 hours after competition or activity.
            <br /> The benefits of this treatment is to start the healing process straight away reventing micro trauma from becoming
            problematic. It cleanses the body helping remove waste products and facilitates relaxation and recovery. This
            technique will prevent stagnation of blood and prevent fluid from accumulating in the muscle tissue.

          <h4>Body Sugaring </h4>
          <p>
            Body Sugaring is a much gentler, safer, and truly progressive method of hair removal for all parts of the body. It is effective
            on all skin types and hair textures for both men and women.

          <h4>Laser Hair Removal </h4>
          <p>
            If you are fed up with less efficient and painful hair removal methods such as plucking, shaving and waxing, isn’t it time
            you considered Laser Hair Removal?
            <br/> At RMC Wellbeing we use Super Hair Reduction Laser Machines (SHR) which is the latest in Laser technology. Not
            only is it virtually painless, it’s much gentler on the skin and has far fewer aftercare considerations.
            <br/> Laser hair removal works by using light energy and heat to penetrate hair follicles, disabling and then destroying
            them at the root while preserving surrounding skin. Results appear after the first treatment with continued benefits
            visible with each additional treatment. Most patients feel treatments aren’t painful, however, since everyone
            has a different pain tolerance, we cannot say this process is pain-free for all patients. Patients describe the
            treatment as feeling as if a tiny rubber band is snapping your skin.
            <br/> Ultimately, laser hair removal‘s success depends on an individual’s unique skin and hair traits, the quality
            of the laser technology being used and most importantly, the skill of the person administering the treatment.
            The laser beam is attracted to the hair follicle melanin (dark colour of the hair). Melanin is also in the skin,
            making laser hair removal possible but more complex for tanned or darker skin people. Likewise, blonde, red and
            grey hairs are more difficult to treat simply because the laser is better attracted to the darker hair colours.
            With that said, our SHR technology and equipment can safely treat most hair and skin types. By having a skin
            analysis and measuring the melanin content in your skin, we will be able to set the parameters that are safe
            for each individual.
            <br/> For best results we advise all patients to do an average of around 6 to 8 treatments every 5 weeks, it is important
            to be consistent and diligent when scheduling future appointments and attending them. Results may vary if appointments
            aren’t kept at the agreed intervals. Thereafter some patients might benefit to do a top-up treatment 2 - 3 times
            a year.

            <p>

        <div id="test6" class="col s12 trans-1">
          <h4>Aesthetic Laser Skin Treatments </h4>
          <p>
            Using the latest technology in skin treatments, the laser beam will penetrate below the skin’s surface, causing a controlled
            trauma, accelerating the promotion of collagen and the natural healing process of the skin, which will create
            healthy tissue eradicating the signs of scarring. The results are smoother, better looking skin, minimal discomfort
            and minimal downtime.
            <br/> Laser is one of safest choices when dealing with Pigmentation and Photo Ageing issues because it targets the
            melanin in the skin. The melanin increases from chronic sun exposure, as do the freckles that result from it.
            With just a few treatments (three to six), dark spots can improve dramatically.
            <br/> The treatment is able to cover a large area and there is little downtime associated with it.” Each session feels
            like a hot bright light on the surface of the skin, similar to a bright flash being fired, is also said to feel
            like a tiny rubber band snap.
            <br/>
            <br/> The Laser Treatments we offer can be used to treat the following skin conditions:
            <br/> • Lightening and removing freckles, sun spots, age marks and brown blotches
            <br/> • Lightening and reducing redness and Rosacea
            <br/> • Reduction and removing of thread veins, spider veins and broken capillary
            <br/> • Acne control
            <br/> • Scar improvement
            <br/> • Removing Cherry Angiomas, also known as Campbell De Morgan spots (blood spots)
            <br/> • Improves skin texture, tones, reduces fine wrinkle and shrinks the pores through collagen stimulation, making
            your skin look more uniform
            <br/>
            <br/> After your first treatment, you can expect to see some redness, darkening the freckles and light swelling. Some
            of those symptoms will disappear within the first 48 hours. A few days post treatment, the treated areas become
            darker (like ground coffee) before they naturally fall off and fade. After about two to three treatments, the
            results will be noticeable, but many patients notice some differences straight after the first treatment. When
            treating veins and broken capillaries the skin will look slightly redder after the treatment for 2 to 5 days.
            Makeup can be used as long as is made out of natural mineral ingredients (Mineralogy or BareFace are very good
            options, NO CHEMICALS), also remember to apply and remove it very gently. For freckles and sun damage the spots
            generally will look even darker for 3 to 7 days, crusting can occur, which may last up to 10 days, the skin will
            then begin to clear.
            <br/>
            <br/> How many laser treatments do you need to have the desired results?
            <br/> Most people need between 3 to 6 treatments at about 4 week intervals. You can see some improvement with each
            treatment but it’s common that the results are slightly different after each treatment. If you are prone to sun
            damage and redness you will most likely require the 6 full treatments or more but you will see gradual clearing
            over time.
            <br/>
            <br/> How long will results last?
            <br/> It will depend on how much sun exposure your skin gets after your laser treatments. If you are in the sun a
            lot and do not use sunscreens, the underlying issues whether they are redness or dark spots will return. If you
            take good care of your skin and keep it protected from the sun, your skin will continue to look good with occasional
            top up maintenance treatments. If you want to maintain collagen growth, we recommend a treatment every 3 months.
